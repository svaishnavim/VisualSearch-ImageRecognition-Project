# VisualSearch-ImageRecognition-Project
Visual Search and Image Recognition Project using CIFAR-10 dataset


- This project consisted of 3 members where we worked on building different deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, LSTM, VGG16, ResNet50 and Sequential.
- We used CIFAR10 dataset which consisted of 60000 images - 6000 in each of the 10 classes. The above listed models are trained to identify different classes using the different images provided, with adjustments made to their hyperparameters when needed.
- The project also used common techniques to increase the effectiveness of the images that were used to train, using methods such as Data Augmentation, Data Normalisation and Data Regularisation.
- In the end, we were able to test the models' accuracy and loss functions to decide which model did the best compared to the others.
